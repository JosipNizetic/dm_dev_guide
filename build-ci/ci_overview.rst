Continuous Integration Services
###############################

We use a number of CI services to aid the developer, the reviewer, and
ensure master is always deployable.

Jenkins
-------

Travis CI
---------


Buildbot
--------

Buildbot is the legacy CI system, and most developers should not be
using it. At this time it is still required for making software
releases. See :doc:`buildbot documentation <deprecated/buildbot`>
