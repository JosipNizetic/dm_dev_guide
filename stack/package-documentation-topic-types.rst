Topic types for package documentation
#####################################

Each reStructuredText (``rst``) file, corresponding to an HTML page, that you add to the :file:`doc/` directory of a package should correspond to a **topic type.**
Topic types are templates and associated guidelines that describe how to structure different types of content.
By conforming to topic types, documentation contributed by a diverse group of collaborators is more structured and uniform.
Structured documentation is easier for readers to navigate and consume.

These are the available topic types for package documentation:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   package-homepage-topic-type
   module-homepage-topic-type
   task-topic-type
   generic-guide-topic-type

Additional topic types are being developed.
