JIRA Agile Usage
################

- Cycles (aka Releases) occur every 6 months.

- Sprints are two-week, fixed timeframes.

- Epics are higher-level features or capabilities that are to be delivered in a
  cycle.  Epic names should be of the form "Area Short Description" (e.g.
  Database qserv refactor)

- Stories describe concrete, demonstrable features to be delivered in a single
  sprint.

- Story points are to be assigned at 2 story points per full-time day of an
  appropriate developer.

- Stories and story points should not be changed once work on a story has
  started.
