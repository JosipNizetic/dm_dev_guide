Publishing Papers and Proceedings
#################################

Papers and conference proceedings written on behalf of the LSST Project are subject to the LSST Project Publication Policy (:lpm:`162`) and are coordinated by the Publication Board.
This page provides pointers to Publication Board documentation.

.. note::

   While scientific publications and conference proceedings are subject to :lpm:`162`, many types of DM communication and documentation are not controlled, including:

   - User guides (software documentation).
   - Technical notes.
   - Design documentation (though LDMs are coordinated by the DM Technical Control Team, TCT).
   - Community forum posts.

Citing DM Technical Notes
=========================

Wherever possible, cite DM design documentation and technotes in addition to the core project papers.
Rather than linking to the technote's URL in a footnote, you should use a proper citation to the technote's DOI in BibTeX.
The documentation engineering team is making DOIs on an as-needed basis at the moment.
Reach out to `#dm-docs <https://lsstc.slack.com/archives/dm-docs>`__ for additional DOIs.
We're working on automating DOI provisioning to make this easier in the future.
