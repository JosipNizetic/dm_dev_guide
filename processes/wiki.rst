Policy on DM Wiki Use
#####################

*Sourced from Jeff Kantor, Nov 2008.*

While we want to foster open source development and a wiki is central to this
purpose, there are certain caveats on what should and shouldn't be posted to
the DM wiki since significant material is open to the public. All wiki users
should ensure the following:

- Review the material you have posted on the wiki to be sure there is nothing
  that is confidential, or that could be embarrassing or used against the
  project. Confidential material would include (for example) partnering plans
  or proposals that are confidential or have not yet been realized, financial
  information, positioning relative to other projects, or comments about
  strengths or weaknesses relative to other projects.

- LSST project-level documents, such as the Security Design, that are not yet
  approved by the :abbr:`CCB (Change Control Board)`, should be labeled as
  **DRAFT** and a note should appear in every page footer that indicates no DM
  wiki documents are approved until they have a Docushare document-ID. When
  the document-ID is assigned, the wiki version should either provide only a
  link to the approved document on Docushare or insert the document-ID and
  change the access to read-only.

The DM Project Manager is responsible for oversight ensuring that the DM wiki
only has appropriate material. The entire DM team is expected to help with
this oversight; if you see something that is suspect, please bring it to the
attention of the DM Project Manager.

Rationale
=========

A proposal for Wiki / Docushare management of LSST project-wide baselined
documents was suggested:

- A document is created and maintained on the DM wiki;
- The document is submitted for approval by the LSST CCB;
- The document is wiki-output to a PDF (or similar output standard) and
  filed in Docushare;
- The Docushare document-ID is embedded in the DM wiki version, the DRAFT
  designation is removed, and then the version on the wiki is marked as
  read-only.
- Further modifications to the document may be done on the DM wiki only if the
  wiki document is relabelled **DRAFT REVISION** at the same time as write
  access is restored;
- The cycle restarts from the beginning.

Once a document is frozen for review and submitted to the LSST configuration
control process in Docushare for approval, it is baselined (put in a specific
location and locked). At this point the requirement is to have a clear and
immutable version that everyone sees that cannot be changed without prior
approval. That is the essence of change control. If the corresponding wiki
pages are to remain in the DM wiki, they must be locked as well.

Note that documents should be subject to very little—and only
incremental—change after baselining, and only after approval of a formal
change request. The interactive DM wiki editing process is less useful for
these documents. If the document is undergoing significant change, it isn't
ready for baselining to begin with, and can editing may continue on the wiki
(subject to the footer indicating its draft status).
