The LSST Stack Handbook
#######################

The LSST Stack is a next-generation pipeline for optical astronomy in the big data era.
We are building the Stack for the `Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) <http://lsst.org>`_, but our Python API allows the stack to be extended for any optical or near-infrared dataset.
