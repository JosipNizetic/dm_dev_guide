.. _machines:

Machines:  (includes VM and Baremetal)
======================================

- lsst-dev01 - login node and submit machine.  Currently the "jump" host to get into the NCSA lsst infrasturcture environment. 
- lsstweb - web services machine 
- VM server machines - running IBM's Vsphere software.   (@ NCSA 3003, NCSA NPCF, and Chile Base) 
   - virtual machines for numberous development environments 
   - databackbone test beds, container type test beds, demo type machines, monitoring machines 
 - lsst-demo - VM for demos
 - ATS gateway - VM
 - lsstdb - mysql infrastucture machine for db support 
 - DAQ - camera simulator systems 
 - L1 test stand - collection of machines for simulating and testing the camera software 
 - ATS archiver - Auxiliary Telecope Archiver system 
 - Nebula - open stack resource (Use at your own risk) 
 - Slurm Batch cluster - 48 compute nodes for processing DRP and other compute needs 
 - Kubernetes (K8s) - 20 compute nodes for containers 
 - Oracle Rac - 6 nodes for the consolidated DB 
 - PDAC - 35 compute nodes for QSERV and SUI systems 
 - Backup - machines dedicated for data movement to and from DR 
 - Xcat and Puppet configuration management machines - 1 compute node 
 - VM head node - management service for all the VM machines 
 - DTN nodes - data transfer nodes, 2 compute nodes 
 - Monitor DB node and other infrastucture machines (influxDB, loghost...) 
 - identity.lsst.org - reset and password machine 
 - network emulator - latency injection environment for simulating the roundtrip to Chile and back in networks.
 - Bro cluster - networking scanning software/hardware (Chile Base) 
 - NCSA provided shared resources : 
     -Jira, LDAP (ncsa3003, ncsanpcf, Chile base, chile summit), kerberos, IDM, Qualys scans for security, Nearline tape, and Firewall systems, Bro clusters (network scanning security) 
 


.. _filesystems:

Filesystems - in GPFS (4.9PB of storage) 
========================================

 - ``/datasets`` - Long term storage of project-approved shared data. Contains immuteable data. This is under a disaster recovery policy that every 30 days it is stored and written to nearline tape.   
 - ``/home`` - Storage of individual-user data. This data is backed up on a daily basis and ncsa retains 30 days of those backups in a snapshot.  It does have quotas on this file system for 1TB for each "directory", and a 1 million INODE quota.  
 - ``/software`` - Central location for maintenance of project-shared software installations that require access from multiple resources. (ie batch, Nebula).
 - ``/sui`` - Shared storage for ephemeral data for the purpose of supporting SUI/T in the PDAC enclave. This file system has no backups or purging.  
 - ``/scratch`` - Ephemeral big-data storage for use in computation and other project-related activities. This is not backed up.  This file system is purged.   Every 30 days a purge policy deleteing files over 180 days.    
 - ``/project`` - Long term big-data storage for use in computation and other project-related activities. This is backed up with 7 days of snapshots.  This file system is not subject to purge.
