Technotes: Just Document It
###########################

Technotes provide a low-barrier way to write documentation and deploy
it as a readable, referencable and discoverable document. You are
encouraged to write technotes to capture any type of single-topic
aspect of software - design decisions, user notes, deployment
documentation, scientific strategies - if you feel the need to write
it and it is not obviously belonging to a single code repository, just
write a technote. 

Technotes are simple rst files in git repositories. The technote
documentation platform is documented (aptly enough) in a technote,
`SQR-000`_.

To boostrap your own technote, use

An automatic indexing system for technotes is in progress; an `interim`_
list of available technotes is maintained manually for now.
