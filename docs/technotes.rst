Technotes for Stand-Alone Technical Documentation
#################################################

Technotes are a way for Data Management team members to write standalone documents that are native to the web, can be cited in literature, and are easy to write, publish, and update.
You can write with either our reStructuredText or LaTeX templates.
All technotes are developed on GitHub and published with `LSST the Docs`_.

When to write technotes
=======================

Some of the possible applications for technotes are:

- Report the results of a project, such as a data processing or software development experiment.
- Announce a new technology, serving as a high-level overview complementing user documentation.
- Propose an architecture, possibly becoming the subject of a :ref:`request for comment (RFC) <decision-making-rfc>`.

For further background, see `SQR-000: The LSST DM Technical Note Publishing Platform <SQR-000>`_.

Technotes are not always the right platform for your information.
Consider these alternatives:

- Change-controlled documentation (``LDM`` documents, for example).
  See :lpm:`19` for guidelines on what kinds of information are change-controlled.
- User documentation (https://pipelines.lsst.io, for example).
  Descriptions of how to use software, services, or data should be written as user documentation.
  Technotes complement user documentation by being point-in-time discussions of software, like a technical blog post.

**To create a new technote,** follow the `instructions for lsst-technote-bootstrap <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lsst-technote-bootstrap>`_.

We're working on a live index of technotes, but in the interim a list of available technotes is `available on community.lsst.org <https://community.lsst.org/t/listing-of-available-dm-technotes/496>`_.
