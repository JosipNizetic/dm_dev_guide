Configuring your GitHub username in your Slack profile
######################################################

Some of DM's Slack integrations need to know your GitHub username to map your activity on GitHub to your Slack account.
Here's how to help us do that by adding your GitHub username to your Slack profile:

1. Visit Slack: https://lsstc.slack.com.

2. Click on the **LSSTC** workspace label in the top-left corner and select **Profile & account** from the drop-down.

3. Add your GitHub username to the **GitHub Username** field of your profile.
   Don't include any prefix like ``@``.
