*Welcome to Data Management*.
This page will help you get the necessary accounts and point you to important resources and documentation.

Accounts
========

LSST account
   Contact ``lsst-sysadmins _at_ lsst.org`` to get a unified LSST account.
   This gives you access to:

   - The internal project website, including travel requests: http://project.lsst.org
   - The JIRA project management app: http://jira.lsstcorp.org/
   - The Confluence wiki: https://confluence.lsstcorp.org

GitHub and LSST organizations
   If you don't have one already, create an account on https://github.org.
   Also see the :doc:`/tools/git_setup` page for recommendations on setting up two-factor authentication and credential helpers for GitHub.

   Next, ask your T/CAM to add you to the `lsst <https://github.com/lsst>`__ and `lsst-dm <https://github.com/lsst>`__ GitHub organizations, along with any relevant team organizations (send your GitHub username to your T/CAM).

NCSA server access
   Contact ``lsst-account _at_ ncsa.illinois.edu`` to request an account on the NCSA cluster, which hosts the reference platform. Include the following in the request:

   - First and last name
   - Email
   - Phone number
   - Mailing address
   - Sponsoring LSST manager
   - LSST Team or project

   Also see: :doc:`/services/lsst-dev`.

Community.lsst.org
   https://community.lsst.org is LSST's public-facing discussion and support forum.
   Browse the `forum-howto <https://community.lsst.org/tags/forum-howto>`_ tag to learn how to use the platform.
   
   Create an account, and let your T/CAM know your username to get access to internal discussion categories.
   
   T/CAMs: add users via the `LSST <https://community.lsst.org/groups/LSST>`__ and `LSSTDM <https://community.lsst.org/groups/LSSTDM>`__ group pages.
   

HipChat
   `HipChat <https://www.hipchat.com/>`_ is DM's internal instant messaging platform.
   Install HipChat on your computer (and phone, if you wish) and then ask your T/CAM for an invitation to DM's group.
   Some important rooms to follow are:
   
   - 'Data Management' for general DM discussion,
   - 'Software Development' for anything about writing software,
   - 'SQuaRE' for developer support services,
   - 'Bot: Jenkins' for our Continuous Integration system,
   - 'Tavern' for "water cooler" type talk,
   - 'Tea Time' for more serious but still non-LSST conversation
   
   Your team may also have specific rooms, and you can send private messages to individuals.

Google account for Hangouts
   Many small meetings are conducted on `Google Hangouts <https://hangouts.google.com/>`_, which requires you to have an account with https://google.com.
   The meeting convener will pass around a Hangouts room URL to attendees.
