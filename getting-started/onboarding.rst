Developer Onboarding Checklist
##############################

*Welcome to Data Management*.
This page will give you an overview of the accounts you'll have as a member of DM.

Some things you can set up yourself, but many accounts require action by your manager.
We've given them a handy :ref:`onboarding-tcam-checklist` at the bottom.

.. _getting-started-lsst-account:

LSST account
============

Contact ``lsst-sysadmins _at_ lsst.org`` to get a unified LSST account.
This gives you access to:

- The internal project website, including travel requests: http://project.lsst.org
- The JIRA project management app: http://jira.lsstcorp.org/
- The Confluence wiki: https://confluence.lsstcorp.org

.. _getting-started-github:

GitHub and LSST organizations
=============================

If you don't have one already, create an account on https://github.com.

Next, ask your T/CAM to add you to the `lsst <https://github.com/lsst>`__ and `lsst-dm <https://github.com/lsst>`__ GitHub organizations, along with any relevant team organizations (send your GitHub username to your T/CAM).
   
.. seealso::

   - :doc:`/tools/git_setup` page for recommendations on setting up two-factor authentication and credential helpers for GitHub.
   - :doc:`/tools/git_lfs` page for configuring Git LFS for DM.

NCSA server access
==================

Contact ``lsst-account _at_ ncsa.illinois.edu`` to request an account on the NCSA cluster, which hosts the reference platform.
Include the following in the request:

- First and last name
- Email
- Phone number
- Mailing address
- Sponsoring LSST manager
- LSST Team or project

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/services/lsst-dev`.

Community.lsst.org
==================

https://community.lsst.org is LSST's public-facing discussion and support forum.
Browse the `forum-howto <https://community.lsst.org/tags/forum-howto>`_ tag to learn how to use the platform.
   
Create an account, and let your T/CAM know your username to get access to internal discussion categories.
   
**T/CAMs:** add users via the `LSST <https://community.lsst.org/groups/LSST>`__ and `LSSTDM <https://community.lsst.org/groups/LSSTDM>`__ group pages.
   

Slack
=====

`Slack <https://slack.com/>`_ is LSST's real-time chat platform.
It is used across the project and by external science collaborations.
Install Slack on your computer (and phone, if you wish), then ask your T/CAM for access to the ‘LSSTC’ team.

Channels which have been set up specifically for Data Management related discussion can be identified by a ‘dm-’ prefix.
Important channels you may wish to follow include:

- ‘announce-everyone’ for project-wide announcements.
- ‘lsst-travel’ for help with travel on project business.
- ‘lsst-newchannels’ for notifications of new channels.
- ‘software-dev’ for anything about writing software.
- ‘dm’ for general DM discussion.
- ‘dm-square’ for developer support services.
- ‘dm-jenkins’ for automatic notifications from our Continuous Integration system.
- ‘dm-tavern’ for “water cooler” type talk.
- ‘dm-tea-time’ for more serious but still non-LSST conversation.

Your team may also have specific channels, and you can send private messages to individuals.

Google account for Hangouts
===========================

Many small meetings are conducted on `Google Hangouts <https://hangouts.google.com/>`_, which requires you to have an account with https://google.com.
The meeting convener will pass around a Hangouts room URL to attendees.

Mailing lists
=============

We don't use mailing lists for conversations, but they're still used for notifications about conversations happening on https://community.lsst.org.
You should be subscribed to these lists as soon as you get an :ref:`LSST acccount <getting-started-lsst-account>`:

- `dm-devel <https://lists.lsst.org/mailman/listinfo/dm-devel>`_
- `dm-staff <https://lists.lsst.org/mailman/listinfo/dm-staff>`_ (internal list)
